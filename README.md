# PyDiffold
`PyDiffold` is a Python library for `differential geometry` on 2D manifolds embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It provides tools for approximating `local differential structure` (tangent spaces, normal vectors, Riemannian metric tensors...), as well as discrete `differential operators` such as surface gradients and the Laplaceâ€“Beltrami 
operator, using only point cloud data.

The library is designed to facilitate numerical experimentation in geometry processing and geometric PDEs by operating directly on sampled surfaces, 
without requiring explicit mesh connectivity.

## PDE
Since `PyDiffold` allows you to define a function as a scalar field, consider a scalar field $\phi(x,y,z;t)$ is defined on a manifold $M$. In the test folder, you can find example code for solving the heat and wave equations on a manifold using PyDiffold computing the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

**Heat Equation:**  
The heat equation models the temporal evolution of temperature \(\phi\) in a medium, describing heat diffusion:  
$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = \alpha \Delta \phi
$$

**Wave Equation:**  
The wave equation models the propagation of disturbances \(\phi\) in a medium, such as sound or electromagnetic waves:  
$$
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \Delta \phi
$$
