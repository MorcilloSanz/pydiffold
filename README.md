# PyDiffold
PyDiffold is a Python library for differential geometric computations on discrete 2D manifolds embedded in $R^3$. It provides tools for approximating local differential 
structure (tangent spaces, normal vectors, and Riemannian metric tensors), as well as discrete differential operators such as surface gradients and the Laplaceâ€“Beltrami 
operator, using only point cloud data.

The library is designed to facilitate numerical experimentation in geometry processing, manifold learning, and geometric PDEs by operating directly on sampled surfaces, 
without requiring explicit mesh connectivity.
