# PyDiffold
`PyDiffold` is a Python library for `differential geometry` on 2D manifolds embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It provides tools for approximating `local differential structure` (tangent spaces, normal vectors, Riemannian metric tensors...), as well as discrete `differential operators` such as surface gradients and the Laplaceâ€“Beltrami 
operator, using only point cloud data.

The library is designed to facilitate numerical experimentation in geometry processing and geometric PDEs by operating directly on sampled surfaces, 
without requiring explicit mesh connectivity.

## PDE
Since `PyDiffold` allows you to define functions on a manifold and perform advanced differential calculations such as the gradient, surface gradient, and Laplace-Beltrami operator, it provides powerful tools to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) on curved spaces.

**Heat Equation:**  
The heat equation governs the diffusion of a scalar field $\phi(x,y,z;t)$ over a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, where $\Delta$ denotes the Laplace-Beltrami operator. It is given by:

$$\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = \alpha \Delta \phi$$

describing how heat dissipates over time according to the intrinsic geometry of the manifold.

**Wave Equation:**  
The wave equation describes the propagation of waves in a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, modeling second-order hyperbolic dynamics of the scalar field $\phi(x,y,z;t)$. It is expressed as:

$$\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \Delta \phi$$ 

where $c$ is the wave speed, and $\Delta$ denotes the Laplace-Beltrami operator, reflecting how curvature influences wave propagation.
